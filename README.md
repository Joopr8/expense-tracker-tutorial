## About the project 
The project was done following the tutorial of [TraversyMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ&list=RDCMUC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA&start_radio=1&t=2127s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) to learn and develop my react skills.
This expense tracker app shows user transactions and the global value of incomes and expenses. You can also add a new transaction.

## Setup

```ruby
npm install

# Run on http://localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for prod
npm run build
```

## Aproach
It uses functional components with hooks and the context API, which will be updated when a new transaction is added.
